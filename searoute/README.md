# SeaRoute

[SeaRoute](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute) computes shortest maritime routes between pairs of locations.

See below an example from [Marseille (5.3E,43.3N)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/43.3/5.3) to [Shanghai (121.8E,31.2N)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/31.2/121.8). The red line is the computed maritime route. The black line is the [great-circle route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance).

**NEW:** It is now possible to compute maritime routes avoiding the Suez and/or Panama channel.

## Usage

### As a program

[SeaRoute](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute) requires Java 1.8 or higher. Run `java --version` to check is Java is installed and what is the current version.

Download the lastest release [here](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute/releases), unzip it and run `java -jar searoute.jar -h` to see the help which describes everything you need to know.

Examples of executions for windows users are provided in `searoute.bat` (for linux users, see `searoute.sh`). `test_input.csv` is an example of input file. It is a simple CSV file with origin/destination coordinates of the routes. Note that only geographical coordinates (decimal degrees) are supported. The output file is a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) file which can be displayed on [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) or any modern GIS software such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org).

### For coders

[SeaRoute](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute) can be used as a Java library. To quickly setup a development environment, see [these instructions](https://eurostat.github.io/README/howto/java_eclipse_maven_git_quick_guide).

Download and install [SeaRoute](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute) with:

```
git clone https://github.com/eurostat/searoute.git
cd searoute
mvn clean install
```

and then use it in your Java project as a dependency by adding it to the *pom.xml* file:

```
<dependencies>
	...
	<dependency>
		<groupId>eu.europa.ec.eurostat</groupId>
		<artifactId>searoute</artifactId>
		<version>1.1</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Here is an example of shortest maritime route computation:

```java
//create the routing object
SeaRouting sr = new SeaRouting();

//get the route between Marseille (5.3E,43.3N) and Shanghai (121.8E,31.2N)
Feature route = sr.getRoute(5.3, 43.3, 121.8, 31.2);

//compute the route distance in km
MultiLineString routeGeom = (MultiLineString) route.getGeom();
double d = GeoDistanceUtil.getLengthGeoKM(routeGeom);

//extract the route in geoJSON format
String rgj = GeoJSONUtil.toGeoJSON(routeGeom);
```

For further overview, see [the documentation](https://eurostat.github.io/searoute/apidocs/).

### As a webservice

To deploy [SeaRoute](https://github.com/eurostat/searoute) as a webservice (Java servlet), run:

```
git clone https://github.com/eurostat/searoute.git
cd searoute
mvn clean package
```

and move the servlet `/target/searoute.war` into your `/tomcatX.Y/webapps/` folder. Go then to http://localhost:8080/searoute/ to see the REST-API documentation and some examples.

## Some additional information

The shortest maritime routes are computed from a network of lines covering the seas and following some of the most frequent martitime routes. This maritime network is based on the *Oak Ridge National Labs CTA Transportation Network Group, Global Shipping Lane Network, World, 2000* (retrieved from [geocommons.com](http://geocommons.com/datasets?id=25) or [github](https://github.com/geoiq/gc_data/blob/master/datasets/25.geojson)), enriched with some additional lines around the European coasts based on [AIS data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system). Simplified versions of this network have been produced for different resolutions (5km, 10km, 20km, 50km, 100km) based on a shrinking of too short edges and a removal of similar edges.

[![Maritime network overview](docs/img/marnet_overview_.png)](docs/img/marnet_overview.png)

The shortest maritime routes are computed from this network using the [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) implemented in the wonderful [GeoTools](https://geotools.org/) library.
